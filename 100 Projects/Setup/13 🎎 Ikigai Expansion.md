We will now begin to expand on them below. Make sure you at least defined the abstract and a bit of its relevance and importance under its dashboard.

## Your Choice
### Why did you choose this discipline as your Ikigai?
`Answer`

## The Past
### What brought you to love these disciplines?
`Answer`

### What have you gone through to be as skilled as you are (or not) in these fields?
`Answer`

### What has the world gone through to need them?
`Answer`

### How has it come to the point that people are paying for it?
`Answer`

### Objectively, from an outsider looking in, would they agree with what you said above? Consider asking another person.
`Answer`

## The Present
### How strongly do your Ikigai disciplines' pillars align with your life pillars? What about their dynamics? Do you think this is a good thing? Why?
`Answer`

### Are you partaking in these disciplines yet? What are you doing?
`Answer`

### If you're not partaking in it, what's blocking you from actively pursuing this discipline? What can you do right now?
`Answer`

## The Future
### Long-term goals are a double-edged sword because once they are met, velocity and direction waver.
**One solution is to play the infinite game. This is a lesson from Simon Sinek's book, The Infinite Game, which observes that naive business operate towards an end-goal, but the most successful operate through infinite values and limitless goals. Does your Ikigai Discipline have pillars akin to that?**
`Answer`

> If your answer does not allow room for sufficient growth, especially over your lifetime, you should consider re-framing this discipline.

### What will you do right now to make velocity towards your Ikigai discipline?
`Answer`

## Epilogue
This is the end of this exploratory session of your life and the setup of LDP. You should a diverse set of Disciplines under your belt, and can now create projects relating to them.

Consider doing another pass on the disciplines to define all of their pillars and dynamics, if not done already.

> You also should have noticed that your Ikigai Discipline should have mostly aligned with your Life Pillars. If they are not, it may cause some conflict in the future.

You can move 📁`Setup` into 📁`900 Archive/Projects` for historical data.

### Tasks and Projects
Start making [[Tasks]] or [[Projects]] that align with disciplines to create velocity towards your life. Projects should have a [[Dashboards|Dashboard]] as well, which should define the project's objective and completion criteria.

### Habits
[[Habits]] are regular practices that allow you to identify and embody a life and discipline. Refer to [[Tasks as Habits in Obsidian]] for setting them up, which should be done within 📁`300 Habits`.

Also consider having **active reminders** (e.g. an alarm) for these habits, as currently Obsidian does not have a reliable method of doing so.

See [[Flossing (Habit)]] as an example.
