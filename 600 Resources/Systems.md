# Systems
A **System** is a group of components that share and process a common form of input to create a new function, experience, or product. This is thought of as the [[Dynamics|Dynamic]].

Input can vary greatly, from human interaction, numbers, water, etc. Input can also come into the system at different steps of processing, not just at the start. Systems can also be self-regulating and provide input to itself, creating a feedback loop. They also usually always have patterns of sorts.

Systems can also be components of other systems. See [[Systems Thinking]].
