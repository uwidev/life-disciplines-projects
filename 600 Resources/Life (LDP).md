# Life (LDP)
**Life** is ideals and values, which can be simplified into [[Pillars]]. These Pillars combine to make a [[Dynamics|Dynamic]], which can be thought of the very core of what kind of person this is.

For example, someone who values the pillars: Family, Sustainability, and Experiences may have a dynamic of "someone who is an outgoing and valuable member to those who they consider family." Likewise, someone who values Inner Peace, Acceptance, and Life's Purpose can be thought of as "someone has become a monk to achieve greatness."

The Pillars and Dynamic that are defined may not be true in the present. This is fine, and it's actually better to define them in the context of your ideals. Who do you want to be? That way, you can start making changes to become who you truly want to be.

You should also be looking for determining your [[Ikigai]], as this is a valuable idea to supporting those changes.
