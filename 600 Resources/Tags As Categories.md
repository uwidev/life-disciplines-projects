# Tags As Categories
Tags might be used as a means of grouping notes together on a particular topic. For example, all notes relating to Exercise will get the tag `#exercise`. Usually notes only get one tag, but 

Tagging this way is useful when folders are structured in a way that doesn't immediately categorize topics, such as under the constraint of flat file systems or anything similar (e.g. [[Zettelkasten]]).

The downside is that it may be more difficult to parse though notes, as these categories may potentially grow too deep. You may need to set filter your first results with something else, and if you only tag in one Category then you must manually look through the notes or search under some other constraint (e.g. path, file name, contents).
