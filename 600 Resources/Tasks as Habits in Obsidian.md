# Tasks as Habits in Obsidian
[[Tasks]] can be automated into [[Habits]] using the [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks) plugin. By formatting tasks as follows, you can have them repeat at regular intervals.

## Formatting
> - #task #hb `<contents>` `[🔁 interval]` `[📅 YYYY-MM-DD]`

`< >` - required
`[ ]` - optional

`interval` denotes how you want this repeated, in plain English. See examples below.

> `every day`
> `every friday`
> `every 2 days`
> `every month`
> `every 2 years`

`#hb` denotes this task as a habit task compared to regular tasks and can appear on their own dedicated views. See [[Habits (View)]] or [[00 🏠 Main Dashboard|🏠 Main Dashboard]].

> If you do not include `#hb`, you will merge habit task and regular tasks. If this is what you want and it works for you, make adjustments as needed.

## Location
Habits, like Tasks, can be sprinkled throughout LDP as needed. However, do consider centralizing a habit to its own note under 📁`300 Habits`.

[[Flossing (Habit)]] has been provided as an example.
