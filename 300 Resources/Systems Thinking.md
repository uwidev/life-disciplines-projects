# Systems Thinking
**Systems Thinking** is a methodology of thought such that a System is merely a component of many other systems. With this in mind, one can examine and analyses how other those systems contribute or hindering activity.

You can think of this as [[Dynamics]] but the components themselves are Systems. 

> Sociology follows a similar thought process as Systems Thinking.

Fundamental knowledge of Systems can be found in [[Systems]].
