## Other Useful Functionality
There are a lot of neat little things that can make your workflow easier. Here's a very sparse list of small productivity hacks in this Vault. Some are set to keybinds that work for me, and I highly suggest you set them to something that works for you.
-  **Hotkeys for starred files:** press `ALT` + `SHIFT` + `1` to immediately open the first starred note in a new pane. You can exclude shift to open it on this pane. If you don't like the hotkey, feel free to change it.
-  **Obsidian Task Archiver:** immediately move all finished `Task` to a header named `Archived`
-  **Natural Language Dates:** Need to quickly enter today's date? Type `@today` then type enter. This works for other natural datas, such as `@in 2 days`. Use this everywhere.
-  **Templater**: LDP uses templates. One thing that it can do is quickly set up a task with defined values. See [[task]] as a quick example. It assumes you already made the line into a task by pressing `CTRL` + `ENTER`.
-  **Note Refactor:** A plugin to quickly refactor notes. I binded it to `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `M` to refactor and use the first line as the header.
-  **Hotkeys++**: Quickly swap a line of text up and down with `ALT` + `W` or `S`. Useful for quickly organizing Tasks.
-  **Sort and Permute Lines:** Quickly sort selected lines alphabetically. Applicable for tasks to sort alphabetically to sort by reverse priority, then reverse the sort to sort by priority. Not essential but still useful.
-  **Emojis:** There's a plugin for it (not installed). If you're on Windows, pressing `WIN` + `.` will bring up an emoji menu. Type emojis and add that special jazz to your workflow.
-  **Open Daily Note $\rightarrow$ Quick Ramblings:** Have something on your mind? `CTRL` + `T` will bring you to your daily journal to ramble on about things.
-  **`#resume` Tag:** Use the `#resume` tag to quickly bookmark a location to come back to it later when you have time. On the [[90 🗃️ Master Backlog|🏠 Main Dashboard]] there's an embeded search query for it. If you click on it, it should bring you immediately back to your work (hopefully). You should add context before you call it a day and add this tag.
-  **[[Curation]]:** This paired with the local graph (top right panel, right-most tab) can help you find gather related resources for a project. 
	-  Say you have a project to do a presentation on the fundamental components of a plant cell. Assuming you have correct links and tags, you can quickly scour for relevant notes by searching for say `#plant #cell #biology` using **Vantage** or **QuickAdd: Chaotic Note Roller**. The latter is preferred when you're stuck on generating ideas while the former is preferred when you have an idea of what you're looking for. This with the local node graph, golden.
